Automated Data Processing with Apache Airflow
What does this data pipeline do?

This data pipeline automates the daily processing of data files by performing the following tasks in a sequential manner:

    Checks the availability of daily files in a designated folder.
    If the files are not found, it leverages the Google Drive API to download them.
    Loads the daily files into the staging layer of a MongoDB database.
    Executes a Spark job to process the data and generate result files.
    Loads the result files from the target folder back into the core layer of the database.

How does this pipeline work well with parallel processing, automation workflow, error handling, and modifications?
Parallel Processing:

    The pipeline benefits from parallel processing capabilities provided by Apache Airflow, allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently.
    For example, while the pipeline checks for file availability, it can simultaneously download files from Google Drive and process existing files in parallel.
    Parallel processing ensures efficient resource utilization and speeds up the overall data processing workflow.

Automation Workflow:

    The pipeline is designed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in Apache Airflow, enabling the automation of the entire data processing workflow.
    Each task in the DAG is triggered automatically based on predefined dependencies and schedule intervals.
    Automation eliminates the need for manual intervention, ensuring the pipeline runs consistently and reliably every day.

Error Handling:

    The data pipeline incorporates error handling mechanisms to handle exceptions and failures gracefully.
    Apache Airflow provides built-in features for task retries, allowing failed tasks to be retried automatically.
    Additionally, error notifications can be configured to alert stakeholders or operators about any pipeline failures or issues.

Modifications:

    The data pipeline is highly modular, allowing for easy modifications and enhancements to accommodate changing requirements.
    New tasks can be added, dependencies can be modified, and existing tasks can be updated as needed without disrupting the entire workflow.
    Apache Airflow's DAG-based structure enables flexibility in modifying the pipeline without affecting other tasks.

Why does this data pipeline fulfill automated data pipeline requirements?
Efficient Data Processing:

    The pipeline leverages parallel processing capabilities, enabling efficient processing of large volumes of data.
    Tasks can be executed concurrently, reducing the overall processing time and improving efficiency.

Automation and Schedule:

    The pipeline is designed to run automatically on a daily schedule, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
    It ensures that the data processing workflow is executed consistently and reliably every day.

Error Resilience:

    The pipeline incorporates error handling mechanisms, such as task retries and error notifications, to handle failures and exceptions.
    This enhances the pipeline's resilience and ensures that issues are addressed promptly, minimizing disruptions.

Modularity and Flexibility:

    The modular structure of the pipeline allows for easy modifications and enhancements as per evolving requirements.
    New tasks can be added or modified without affecting the overall workflow, providing flexibility and adaptability.

Scalability:

    The pipeline can handle large volumes of data due to its parallel processing capabilities and distributed computing with Spark.
    It scales seamlessly to accommodate growing data volumes and processing demands.

In summary, this data pipeline automates the daily processing of data files using Apache Airflow. It leverages parallel processing, automation workflow, error handling, and flexibility to efficiently process large volumes of data, ensure reliability, and adapt to changing requirements.
